# 🖊️ Smart Assistive Tool for Dyslexic Individuals using AI & TTS

An AI-powered assistive system designed to help dyslexic individuals read printed text easily by converting it into clear audio output using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology.

This project focuses on improving accessibility and independent learning through low-cost hardware and intelligent software integration.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Dyslexic individuals often face difficulty in reading printed text, which affects education and daily activities. Existing assistive tools are either expensive or not easily accessible.  
This project aims to provide an affordable, portable, and AI-driven reading assistant that converts real-world text into speech in real time.

## 💡 Solution Overview

The system captures images of printed text using a camera module, processes the image using OCR to extract text, and then converts the recognized text into speech using TTS, allowing users to hear the content clearly.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Capture image using camera module  
2. Preprocess image for better OCR accuracy  
3. Extract text using OCR (Tesseract)  
4. Convert extracted text to speech using TTS  
5. Play audio output through speaker/headphones
